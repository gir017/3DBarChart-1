## Bar3D Visual

This repository contains the source codes of a static version of the Power BI Custom Visual - 3D Bar Chart by @zBritva
![Preview](https://github.com/julmoser/3DBarChart/blob/master/preview.PNG)

The visual groups data by two categories and visualizes values by drawing several bars into a 3d scene.

Where visual puts the first category at X axis and the second category at Y axis.

The value of group determines height of bar.

A grid helper is added.

To start dev server and debug the visual
`npm run start`
To create package call
`npm run package`

`pbiviz start` or `pbiviz package` will not work
